This is a webscraper that, given a text file of course IDs and section numbers, scrapes [Mississippi State University's Master Schedule](https://mybanner.msstate.edu/BannerExtensibility/customPage/page/msuPublicMasterSchedule) for the section's title, instructor, and most importantly, the number of seats available.

I used this to easily track how many seats were left in the courses I wanted when registering each semester. I have registered for my final semester of college and therefore no longer need this. I am archiving this on GitHub so I can safely delete it from my laptop.
